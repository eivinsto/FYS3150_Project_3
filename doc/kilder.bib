@book{Datta2010,
abstract = {2nd ed. Full of features and applications, this acclaimed textbook for upper undergraduate level and graduate level students includes all the major topics of computational linear algebra, including solution of a system of linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems, computation of eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and singular value problems. Drawing from numerous disciplines of science and engineering, the author covers a variety of motivating applications. When a physical problem is posed, the scientific and engineering significance of the solution is clearly stated. Each chapter contains a summary of the important concepts developed in that chapter, suggestions for further reading, and numerous exercises, both theoretical and MATLAB and MATCOM based. The author also provides a list of key words for quick reference. The MATLAB toolkit available online, 'MATCOM', contains implementations of the major algorithms in the book and will enable students to study different algorithms for the same problem, comparing efficiency, stability, and accuracy. 1.

abstract = {Differential equations program • Ordinary differential equations, Runge-Kutta method,chapter 8 • Ordinary differential equations with boundary conditions: one-variable equations to be solved by shooting and Green's function methods, chapter 9 • We can solve such equations by a finite difference scheme as well, turning the equation into an eigenvalue problem. Still one variable. Done in projects 1 and 2. • If we have more than one variable, we need to solve partial differential equations, see Chapter 10 The material on differential equations is covered by chapters 8, 9 and 10. Two of the final projects deal with ordinary differential equations. Differential Equations, chapter 8 The order of the ODE refers to the order of the derivative on the left-hand side in the equation dy dt = f (t, y). (1) This equation is of first order and f is an arbitrary function. A second-order equation goes typically like d 2 y dt 2 = f (t, dy dt , y). (2) c 1999-2017, Morten Hjorth-Jensen.
