@book{Datta2010,
abstract = {2nd ed. Full of features and applications, this acclaimed textbook for upper undergraduate level and graduate level students includes all the major topics of computational linear algebra, including solution of a system of linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems, computation of eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and singular value problems. Drawing from numerous disciplines of science and engineering, the author covers a variety of motivating applications. When a physical problem is posed, the scientific and engineering significance of the solution is clearly stated. Each chapter contains a summary of the important concepts developed in that chapter, suggestions for further reading, and numerous exercises, both theoretical and MATLAB and MATCOM based. The author also provides a list of key words for quick reference. The MATLAB toolkit available online, 'MATCOM', contains implementations of the major algorithms in the book and will enable students to study different algorithms for the same problem, comparing efficiency, stability, and accuracy. 1. Linear algebra problems, their importance, and computational difficulties -- 2. A review of some required concepts from core linear algebra -- 3.

Still one variable. Done in projects 1 and 2. • If we have more than one variable, we need to solve partial differential equations, see Chapter 10 The material on differential equations is covered by chapters 8, 9 and 10. Two of the final projects deal with ordinary differential equations. Differential Equations, chapter 8 The order of the ODE refers to the order of the derivative on the left-hand side in the equation dy dt = f (t, y). (1) This equation is of first order and f is an arbitrary function. A second-order equation goes typically like d 2 y dt 2 = f (t, dy dt , y). (2) c 1999-2017, Morten Hjorth-Jensen.

@article{Emilio2012,
abstract = {The Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory observed the transits of Mercury on 2003 May 7 and 2006 November 8. Contact times between Mercury and the solar limb have been used since the seventeenth century to derive the Sun's size but this is the first time that high-quality imagery from space, above the Earth's atmosphere, has been available. Unlike other measurements, this technique is largely independent of optical distortion. The true solar radius is still a matter of debate in the literature as measured differences of several tenths of an arcsecond (i.e., about 500km) are apparent. This is due mainly to systematic errors from different instruments and observers since the claimed uncertainties for a single instrument are typically an order of magnitude smaller. From the MDI transit data we find the solar radius to be 96012 ± 009 (696, 342 ± 65 km). This value is consistent between the transits and consistent between different MDI focus settings after accounting for systematic effects. {\textcopyright} {\textcopyright} 2012.
